Project Title: Housing Society Grand Event - Data-Driven Planning and Optimization
This capstone project simulates a real-world scenario for a data analyst working with a housing society to organize a grand event. 
The project leverages datasets containing resident information, flat details, and event preferences. 
By analyzing this data, we aim to empower the housing society committee with data-driven insights to optimize event logistics, decoration, and catering services.
